# Double-Hashing
A website that demonstrates the Double Hashing technique used on open-addressed hash tables.
It allows the user to enter values into the hash table, and highlights where they end up in green. If there are any potential collisions, the animation highlights them in a color that is a shade of red, orange, or yellow, in chromatic order.
